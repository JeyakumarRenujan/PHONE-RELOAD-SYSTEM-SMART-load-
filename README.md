# PHONE-RELOAD-SYSTEM(SMART load) <br>
Phone Reload System (SMART load) GUI Project using C++/CLR in Visual Studio
### INTRODUCTION:
<p>In today's world, using our phones is a big part of our lives. Connecting us with the world and facilitating 
communication. A routine task for many of us involves reloading our mobile credits to stay connected, 
whether it's for calls, texts, or internet usage. Recognizing the widespread nature of this need, our team set 
out to create a solution that transcends demographic boundaries that is, online mobile reload system. It is a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) project. We named our project as smart load. It like a smart and easy way 
to reload your phone credit. Imagine it as a cool and friendly assistant that makes reloading quick and 
simple.</p>
<p>We concentrated on every mistake that a user can make throughout the project and made relevant 
adjustments to fix it. For examples, forgetting the password or the username, inputting invalid mobile 
numbers etc.</p>
<p>Since this project is done without including a data base system to manage userâ€™s account, we made a default 
account named <b>Admin</b> to proceed the payments and the password for this default account was <b>group17</b>.
</p>
<p>And we also justified changing the password process by replacing the old password with the new one, inorder to change the old password if forgot, we can use the mail id that was used for creating the account for
the first time to proceed, for this default account we use <b>group17@gmail.com</b> as the mail id.</p>
<p>We also made relevant adjustments to make the user to use this interface repeatedly until they want to stop.</p>
